<h3 class="inline-b7cc2b0bde">Why You Need to Use PDF Express</h3>

<p class="inline-7d27179924">
The IEEExplore requirements for PDF are enforced as of {{site.year}}. All conference articles submitted to
IEEE sponsored conferences must be in IEEExplore-compatible PDF format.
<br/>
IEEE offers PDF Express as a free service to IEEE conference authors, allowing you to make
IEEExplore-compatible PDFs (Conversion Function) or to check PDFs you have created yourself for
IEEExplore compatibility (PDF Check Function).
</p>


<h3 class="inline-b7cc2b0bde">Advantages to Authors</h3>
