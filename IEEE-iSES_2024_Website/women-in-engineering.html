                        Imagine a life without the words www or http? They emerged one fine day from a scientific laboratory! The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN Geneva, Switzerland is home to thousands of high energy physicists. By exploiting large sophisticated radiation detectors, designed and constructed over decades, we are collectively seeking answers to questions about the origin, evolution and composition of our universe. At this forefront of scientific pursuit, working hand in hand with industries, spin off technologies have completely changed our lives. With the world wide web, medical imaging, diagnostic and treatment techniques, high-performance computing, art restoration to name a few - the audacious, innovative cutting edge technologies of particle physics have entered and transformed mainstream society. In this talk I will trace my exciting adventure at CERN and how we can collectively fight pandemics and catastrophes that are unknowns like COVID19 and some known challenges like cancer.

A Ph.D. from Delhi University in 1989, a D.Sc. from the University of Geneva in 1996, and an MBA from International University in Geneva Archana has worked at CERN experiments on R&D and commissioning of large-scale radiation detectors. She is the founder and Project Manager of CMS GEM Collaboration since 2008, bringing a new technology GEM (Gas Electron Multiplier) - for exploiting one of the most sensitive detectors with the highest discovery potential. The GEM project spanned about 40 institutions in 17 countries yielding over 75 PhDs under her leadership, many from India and including technology transfers with Indian industries. Archana also serves as Senior Advisor heading Relations with International Organisations at CERN, in support of CERN's objective of integrating and highlighting fundamental research towards Science Diplomacy for Sustained Development Goals. Dr. Sharma is Head of the Engagement Office for the ‘Compact Muon Solenoid’ Experiment at CERN which connects her with a collaboration spanning 57 countries and about 250 institutions. She has collaborated with events at the ILO Geneva and World Communication Forum Davos as spokesperson for diversity, excellence in scientific communication. She is well known for her relentless efforts in mentoring hundreds of young students particularly girls in STEM, via her NGO based in New Delhi. Archana is also a patent owner of a family of gas detectors, an author of over 1600 publications and 4 popular science books.
