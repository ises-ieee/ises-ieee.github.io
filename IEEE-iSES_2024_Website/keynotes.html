                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        The artificial intelligence (AI) industry is currently focused on achieving superintelligence in a top-down fashion by training a very large (hundreds of billions to trillions of parameters) omniscient multimodal model using a large language model (LLM) as the base. This approach is insatiably thirsty for data during training, leading to unsustainable CO2 emissions. Even after incurring such huge computational and energy costs, these models are known to hallucinate. This makes it difficult to employ such models in domains where accuracy is important, e.g., smart healthcare. We propose to take the opposite tack – build medical superintelligence bottom-up, modeled after how superintelligence is achieved in the human society. Each of us just has human intelligence, but a society of humans achieves superintelligence in a bottom-up fashion by looking at the problem from diverse angles. Could we build medical superintelligence in the same bottom-up fashion through a society of medical AI assistants and AI agents? The AI assistants will serve as aides to health professionals. AI agents will have more autonomy. They need to be accompanied by a robust reasoning framework, e.g., counterfactual (what-if) reasoning. The current top-down approach to developing AI agents is based on using LLMs for reasoning. However, LLMs exhibit a very uneven reasoning performance. Our medical superintelligence framework will take inspiration from neuroscience and include episodic and working memories to facilitate reasoning. The AI assistants in our superintelligence framework will be based on fine-tuned foundation models, targeted at various modalities, e.g., physiological signals, medical images, and medical text, that can be trained data-efficiently and are aligned with each other.  The initial goals of the framework are accurate disease detection, individual well-being, interpretability of AI predictions, and personalized medical decision-making. In this talk, we will explore our initial progress towards realizing this vision.

                        In this talk,  we introduce the basic model of quantum computing. Next,  we give a snapshot of algorithms for certain problems for which remarkable speed-up over classical computing has been achieved by quantum computing. Then, with a brief sketch of the progress in technology, we present specific challenges in design automation for quantum circuits comprising a cascade of error-prone gates.

						FPGAs are ubiquitous in cloud computing, offering flexibility and high performance across diverse applications. Multi-tenancy is typically used to exploit the full potential of FPGAs. However, multi-tenancy introduces major security vulnerabilities. An adversary may exploit dynamic reconfigurability by deploying malicious power-wasters such as ring oscillator (RO)-based circuits on the FPGA. The ROs can cause abrupt voltage fluctuations, leading to fault-injection in a user bitstream and denial of service.
                    </p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">
						To detect the malicious power-wasters and block them from FPGA configuration, machine learning (ML)-based techniques incorporating convolutional neural networks and graph convolutional networks have been explored. ML models successfully detect a wide range of stealthy and emerging threats, without requiring dedicated hardware and time-intensive reverse engineering. This keynote presentation will describe the vulnerabilities of multi-tenant FPGAs and demonstrate the scalability and efficiency of ML-based detection models, paving the way for secure and reliable FPGA deployment in cloud services.

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
						Approximation has long enabled humans to perform rapid calculations with just enough precision for effective task execution. Human senses—such as hearing and vision—are built on approximate mechanisms, which serve exceptionally well. In mathematics, approximation techniques like rounding or the Newton-Raphson method for integration are frequently relied upon. Similarly, approximation has become critical in computing, with techniques such as MP3 encoding removing unnecessary audio components to create smaller files.

						This talk will focus on a hardware-driven approach to optimizing AI circuits and systems by reducing the size of integer and floating-point multipliers and dividers. Approximate arithmetic units, however, often introduce bias, where errors skew positively or negatively. This bias can accumulate across units in complex AI systems, potentially degrading performance or reliability. Therefore, minimizing bias is essential to designing practical AI circuits that support large-scale, real-time processing.
						A novel design method and specialized circuits will be presented, which deliver compact, highly energy-efficient, and minimally biased approximate units. These designs are particularly well-suited for AI applications, where minor approximations can significantly reduce area and energy use without impacting overall accuracy. Applications will be illustrated in which approximation has a negligible effect on output, enabling more efficient AI architectures with potentially reduced reliance on fixed-point arithmetic. This approach opens up new possibilities for building smaller, faster, and more energy-conscious AI systems.
